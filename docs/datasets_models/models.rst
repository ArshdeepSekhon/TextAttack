Models
===============

User-specified models
=========================

TextAttack allows users to provide their own models for testing. Models can be loaded in three ways: 

1. ``--model`` for pre-trained models and models trained with TextAttack
2. ``--model-from-huggingface`` which will attempt to load any model from the ``HuggingFace model hub <https://huggingface.co/models>``
3. ``--model-from-file`` which will dynamically load a Python file and look for the ``model`` variable

Model Wrappers
*************************
TextAttack can attack any model that takes a list of strings as input and outputs a list of predictions. This is the idea behind *model wrappers*: to help your model conform to this API, we've provided the ``textattack.models.wrappers.ModelWrapper`` abstract class.

.. automodule:: textattack.models.wrappers.model_wrapper
   :members:


We've also provided implementations of model wrappers for common patterns in some popular machine learning frameworks:

.. automodule:: textattack.models.wrappers.pytorch_model_wrapper
   :members:

.. automodule:: textattack.models.wrappers.tensorflow_model_wrapper
   :members:

.. automodule:: textattack.models.wrappers.sklearn_model_wrapper
   :members:

.. automodule:: textattack.models.wrappers.huggingface_model_wrapper
   :members:


Pre-trained models
=====================

TextAttack also provides lots of pre-trained models for common tasks. Testing different attacks on the same model ensures attack comparisons are fair. 

Any of these models can be provided to ``textattack attack`` via ``--model``, for example, ``--model bert-base-uncased-mr``. For a full list of pre-trained models, see the `pre-trained models README <https://github.com/QData/TextAttack/tree/master/textattack/models>`_.
